This is the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) repository for software that I use.

To use this tap, run:

```sh
brew tap ligurio/homebrew-repo
```

You can then run the usual commands for acquiring the software. For example:

```sh
brew install testres
brew uninstall testres
```

The following formulae are available:

- [testres](https://github.com/ligurio/testres): hyperfast web frontend for software testing results
- [postgrespro](https://github.com/postgrespro/postgrespro): PostgrePro (feature-rich PostgreSQL fork)
